## What is Struttura?

**Struttura** is a Minecraft ecosystem that lets players **create**, **share**, and **discover** buildings across the community. Design your creations in-game, push them to the cloud, browse what others have built, and populate your survival worlds with player-made buildings — all without leaving Minecraft.

## The Mod — Two Editions

Struttura comes in **two mod variants**, both included in a single download:

### Architect

The **creative toolkit**. Use the **Construction Hammer** to select, edit, and manage your builds. Push your creations to the Struttura cloud, pull them back in other worlds, and browse the community catalog — all from an in-game GUI or via `/struttura` commands.

- Select areas and save buildings with metadata & rooms
- Define **randomized rooms** within a building — each spawn picks a different layout
- Push/pull creations to and from the Struttura cloud
- Browse, search, and like community buildings
- Manage your building library directly in-game

### Spawner

The **adventure engine**. As you explore your survival world, player-made buildings spawn naturally around you — turning every journey into a discovery. Stumble upon incredible creations from the community, explore them, and **like the ones you love** directly in-game. Your likes support the original builders and help the best creations rise to the top. Buildings can include **mobs** and **command blocks**, so creators can design full-blown adventures, traps, and interactive experiences for you to discover!

- Buildings appear as you explore new chunks — every adventure is unique
- Creations can contain mobs, entities, and command blocks for real adventures
- Discover and **like** community creations without leaving the game
- Smart placement engine: evaluates terrain, checks conditions, respects limits
- Fully configurable spawn radius, frequency, and buffer zones
- Choose which building collections appear in your world
